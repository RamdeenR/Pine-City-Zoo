    <h1>GIRAFFE</h1>
    <h4>Our giraffes love company</h4>
    <p><img src="images/giraffe-large.jpg"></p>
    <p>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant.</p>
    <p>Its species name refers to its camel-like shape and its leopard-like colouring. </p>
    <p>Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns.</p>
    <p>It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi.</p>
    <p>The nine subspecies are distinguished by their coat patterns.</p>
    <p>The giraffe's scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east.</p>
    <p>Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands. Their primary food source is acacia leaves, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.</p>
    <p>Giraffes are preyed on by lions; their calves are also targeted by leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs.</p>
    <p>Adult giraffes do not have strong social bonds, though they do gather in loose aggregations if they happen to be moving in the same general direction.</p>
    <p>Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon.</p>
    <p>Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.</p>
