    <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea.</p>
    <p>Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).</p>
    <p>Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. 
    <P>Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb)</p>
    <p>All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects.</p>
    <p>Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging.</p>
    <p>Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight.</p>
    <p>African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
    <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes.</p>
    <p>They prefer to stay near water.</p>
