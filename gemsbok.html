    <h1>GEMSBOK</h1>
    <h4>Come and see the majestic Gemsbok</h4>
    <p><img src="images/gemsbok.jpg"></p>
    <p>The gemsbok or gemsbuck (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the Oryx genus.</p>
    <p>It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert.</p>
    <p>Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies.</p>
    <p>The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia, where the current population of the species is estimated at 373,000 individuals.</p>
    <p>The name "gemsbok" in English is derived from Afrikaans gemsbok, which itself is derived from the Dutch name of the male chamois, gemsbok.</p>
    <p>Although some superficial similarities in appearance (especially in the facial pattern) are noticed, the chamois and the oryx are not closely related.</p>
